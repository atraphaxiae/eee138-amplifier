= Specifications
We are tasked with creating a two-stage common-emitter amplifier to drive an #qty(8, "O") speaker.
The target specifications of the amplifier are shown in @t:spec.

#figure(
	table(
		table.header[Specification][Value],
		[Voltage Gain]           , $>= 200$,
		[DC Output Voltage]      , qtyrange(2.7, 3.5, "V"),
		[Source Impedance]       , qty(1000, "O"),
		[Output Impedance]       , $< #qty(100, "O")$,
		[Supply Voltage]         , [#qty(6, "V"), single supply],
		[Total Power Dissipation], $< #qty(2, "W")$,
	),
	caption: [Specifications of the Amplifier]
) <t:spec>

In addition, the amplifier must also be able to amplify a #qty(10, "mV")pp,
#qtyrange(500, 10000, "Hz") sine wave input with no clipping. Since low output resistance is
specified, we need to include an emitter-follower stage after the second common-emitter stage.

We may only use 2N4401, 2N4403, 2N3904, and 2N3906 transistors, as well as any reasonably common set
of resistors and capacitors. To avoid overheating, we may use parallel transistors.
